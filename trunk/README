The Rlsf package provides a functions for using R with the LSF
cluster/grid queuing system.  Consequently, LSF must be installed
and available in order to build and use the Rlsf package.

The following environment variables must be properly set in order to
successfully build the Rlsf package:

	LSF_ENVDIR
	LSF_INCLUDEDIR
	LSF_LIBDIR
	
Provided that these are properly set, the package can be built and
installed via the standard R mechananism:

	R CMD INSTALL Rlsf


Note: when using gcc on some platforms (notably Solaris), gcc will 
often be creating 32 bit binary images, even on 64 bit machines. In
some cases, the LSF_LIBDIR as set by LSF will point to 64 bit libbat.a
and liblsf.a libraries, and the linking step for Rlsf.so will fail
because of a mismatch in the binary type. In order to fix this problem
you will need to override the value from the profile.lsf of your 
LSF installation by setting the LSF_LIBS environment variable. 

For example, if LSF is installed in /usr/local/lsf, and the configure
script has used /usr/local/lsf/6.2/sparc-sol7-64/lib as the LSF_LIBDIR,
you can override this choice by setting:

LSF_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lsf/6.2/sparc-sol7-32/lib -lbat -llsf"

in the shell before running "R CMD build".

You will also need to update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to reference
the 32 bit libraries rather than the 64 bit libraries.

You must have installed the sparc-sol7-32 architecture package 
according to the LSF documentation, before installing the Rlsf package.
